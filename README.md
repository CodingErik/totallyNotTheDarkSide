# SPACE PORTAL

This is a application where you can access data related to space. You can see when the next space launches will be, browse the hubble glossary and find the description to a term you don't know.
You can look at recent news about anything space. This application is powered by 6 different APIs to retrieve an image of the day, upcoming launch dates, a quote that refreshes with every visit, a Space Flight News search, a Spacex search that returns information on SpaceX rockets, and Hubble glossary to search for astronomy definitions.

The following image demonstrates the application functionality:
